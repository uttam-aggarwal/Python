'''The task is to generate a random story every time user runs the program.
Every time the user runs the program, we must produce a random tale. 
We'll first store the portions of the tales in distinct lists, and then use the Random module
 to choose random sections of the stories from those lists:
To construct a random narrative, we first imported the random module, then built sections of 
the stories in separate lists, then randomly picked portions of the lists.
Note: You store the portion of your tale/story in different lists, and during displaying the story 
when you pick the portions randomly your complete story must make some sense.'''
