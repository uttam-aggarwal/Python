'''Your task is to build a currency converter that will allow you to convert currencies from 
one unit to another, such as converting Indian rupee into pounds, euros, US dollar, Canadian dollar, 
Chinese yuan, Russian Rubal, etc. or vice versa.
In this project build a TUI (Text based user interface), where you will enter the source currency to be 
converted and conversion rate. And after conversion display the amount in the target currency.'''
